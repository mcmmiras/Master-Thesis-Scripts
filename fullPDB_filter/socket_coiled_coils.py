# Usage: python script.py path_to_fullPDB pdb_list(.txt)
# This script detects which helical structures are considered coiled-coils.


# INFORMATION:

# SOCKET:
# What you need to run SOCKET:
# 	1)	A PDB-format file to examine (ex., ent file)
# 	2)	A DSSP-format file generated from the PDB file

# DSSP:
# IMPORTANT: If you are using the recent version of DSSP, you must cut the 1-136 (both included) of DSSP output file
# for further use with SOCKET 2.0.
#   1)  This is a rewrite of DSSP, now offering full mmCIF support. The difference with previous releases of DSSP
#       is that it now writes out an annotated mmCIF file by default, storing the secondary structure information
#       in the _struct_conf category.
#   2)  Another new feature in this version of DSSP is that it now defines Poly-Proline helices as well.
